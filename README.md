# To-do list (fix, add, remove, etc.)
1) players should be able to move around/open menus/type with "chatsounds list" box open
2) copying the text in the list box doesnt always copy to the end (misses last character)
3) no ctrl+F ( find / search ) feature for the list box
4) Sounds play all at once on the same line, rather than waiting for the previous one to finish
