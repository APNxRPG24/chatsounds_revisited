# Chatsounds Revisited
An updated and improved chatsounds addon for Garry's Mod.</br></br>
If you have any comments, suggestions, or just want to know more about the addon, visit the Steam workshop page.</br>
# How to install
Download the repository (i.e. Download ZIP).</br>
Put the "chatsounds" folder in "steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/".
# To-do list (fix, add, remove, etc.)
1) players should be able to move around/open menus/type with "chatsounds list" box open
2) copying the text in the list box doesnt always copy to the end (misses last character)
3) no ctrl+F ( find / search ) feature for the list box
4) Sounds play all at once on the same line, rather than waiting for the previous one to finish
