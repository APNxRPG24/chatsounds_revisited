# chatsounds_revisited
An updated and improved chatsounds addon for Garry's Mod.<br/>
Place in "garrysmod/addons/".
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
To-do list

1) players should be able to move around/open menus/type with "chatsounds list" box open
2) copying the text in the list box doesnt always copy to the end (misses last character)
3) no ctrl+F ( find / search ) feature for the list box
4) Sounds play all at once on the same line, rather than waiting for the previous one to finish
